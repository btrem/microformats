                This page has moved to
                <a href="https://btrem.github.io/microformats/food-menu">food-menu</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                I wrote up a draft proposal to help me figure out what might work and what might not.
                I learn by doing, so I marked up examples based on real menus that I once published
                for two restaurants that I used to work for. So by necessity, I need class names,
                including a root class name. Following the
                <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#microformats2_design">microformats2 design patterns</a>,
                I went with <b>h-menu</b>, and gave the folder that name. I later learned that
                naming microformats is
                <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/process#Naming_considerations">discouraged</a>.
                So, I renamed the folder. My apologies for any inconvience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Incidentally, the process of creating html food menus with microformats did
                give me ideas of things to do or avoid, which I shared on the
                <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/menu-brainstorming">menu brainstorming</a> page.
