# about this repo
This repo stores my contributions to
[microformats](http://microformats.org/).
The mf community maintain a
[microformats wiki](https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page)
where I have made some contributions. This place is to try
out ideas that are unwieldy for the wiki, such as demo pages
for microformat patterns that I have proposed or am investigating.

You can view demo pages on the
[website connected to this repo](https://btrem.github.io/microformats/),
with links to demo pages.
